'''repair_torrc() function will be called when we want to gurantee the existence of:

2.  "#DisableNetwork 0" line in /etc/tor/torrc
3.  "%include /etc/torrc.d" line in /etc/tor/torrc
4.  /etc/torrc.d/ directory

'fixed_missing_torrc' if missing /etc/tor/torrc is fixed 
'fixed_missing_line' if the missing "#DisableNetwork 0" or/and "%include /etc/torrc.d" line is fixed
